      as a Chief Software Architect & Director, where I delivered 6 major
      projects within a year of taking charge. A part of my role was working
      with the Business Development team to establish the company’s portfolio,
      expanding the business verticals. I was also an integral part of the
      hiring and building of the company’s software team. Additionally, I
      managed a cross-platform team comprising of 6 frontend, backend, and cloud
      engineers.

      learn piano. -->

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and
      design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
      design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build
      applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while
      providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably
      enjoying a variety of activities like playing soccer, cycling, or crossing
      off another item on my bucket list.
